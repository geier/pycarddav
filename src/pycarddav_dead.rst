pyCardDAV is dead
=================

As you may have noticed, development of pyCardDAV has been dormant for some time
and I herewith declare it officially dead. While I always wanted to `rewrite it
on top of vdir <https://github.com/geier/pycarddav/issues/92>`_, I lack the time
to do it (and all hacking time I found was spent on `khal
<http://lostpackets.de/khal/>`_).  A good alternative seems to be `khard
<https://github.com/scheibler/khard>`_.

As I still use pyCardDAV myself, I will still fix bugs against Davical for the
foreseeable future, but don't expect anything else.
