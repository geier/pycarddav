Submitting a Bug
================

If you found a bug or any part of pycarddav isn't working as you
expected, please check if that bug is either already reported at 

https://github.com/geier/pycarddav/issues?state=open

or is already fixed on github.

You can check it out and install via:

 git clone https://github.com/geier/pycarddav
 cd pycarddav
 python setup.py install

If the bug persists, always run the command again with the --debug option
and paste the output of that (of course you can edit out any private
details like your username and resource).

Also, it is often helpful if you include which OS you are on, which
version of python and, in the case the problems occur during sync, which
version of requests you are using. You can just run the file at
https://gist.github.com/geier/5814123#file-debug_helper-py
and paste the
output.

If the error occurs during sync, please also supply details on your
CardDAV server (which server and version).
